        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, I’m Jiho Ahn, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside with a strong interest in public health, education, and research. I am pursuing a degree in chemistry, and much of my work exists at the intersection of science, policy, and community service. My academic path has been shaped not only by lab work and lectures but also by hands-on experiences in student government, healthcare advocacy, and cross-campus organizing. I currently serve as the Chief Financial Officer for the University of California Student Association, where I help manage financial operations and guide systemwide budget planning for student-led initiatives. I’ve worked with a wide range of stakeholders—from professional staff to student leaders—presenting financial reports, communicating funding processes, and ensuring that budgets reflect student needs and priorities. This work has strengthened my understanding of strategic planning and fiscal responsibility in nonprofit and education-based organizations. Previously, I served as the Vice Chair of the Campus Action Committee, where I developed and implemented student advocacy campaigns on local and statewide issues. That experience deepened my skills in coalition building and policy communication, and gave me opportunities to help shape conversations around equity, access, and education reform across multiple UC campuses. At UC Riverside, I’ve held several leadership roles within the Associated Students of UC Riverside (ASUCR), including External Director of Campus Partnership, where I led the Highlander Action Committee. In that role, I helped coordinate student responses to legislative and institutional challenges, organizing efforts on topics such as affordability, representation, and wellness. I also supported international students through my time as Vice Chair of the International Student Committee, working to strengthen pathways to resources and advocate for policy improvements on their behalf. Beyond governance, I am deeply involved in community health education and nonprofit service. At the Citrus Free Clinic, I’ve served in various roles including Health Education Committee Officer, Women’s Health Committee Officer, and Clinic Volunteer. I’ve led outreach events, organized presentations for underserved communities, and contributed to efforts focused on preventive care and health literacy. These experiences have shown me the importance of accessible and culturally informed healthcare education. In addition to community health work, I am actively engaged in undergraduate research. I currently work in a wound healing biology lab, contributing to experimental studies aimed at improving clinical understanding of tissue regeneration. Separately, I also study chemistry education, where I investigate how flipped classroom models affect student performance and engagement in STEM courses. I’ve had the opportunity to present findings at research conferences, where I focus on connecting data to tangible outcomes in teaching and learning. I also serve as a First Year Mentor at UCR, developing programming and providing mentorship to support students transitioning into college life. This role has allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in leadership, education, and student engagement to help others navigate academic and social challenges. Outside of school, I support international and public health work through nonprofit leadership. As Director of Public Relations for Global Water Brigades, I manage digital outreach and content strategy for initiatives focused on water access and health education. I also serve as an Executive Officer for the Let It Be Foundation, helping manage team operations and streamline internal planning in support of children and families affected by serious illness. I’m drawn to work that is mission-driven, collaborative, and rooted in real-world impact. I enjoy solving complex problems, translating data into action, and building structures that help people succeed—whether in a classroom, a clinic, or a community organization. Looking ahead, I am interested in career paths that integrate public health, education policy, and evidence-based strategy. I aim to continue building projects that connect science, service, and systems thinking.
